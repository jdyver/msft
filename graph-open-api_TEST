Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation. This method allows a caller to find all the assignments belonging to a student or a teacher in a single call rather than having to request assignments from each class. The assignment list contains what is needed to get the detailed information for the assignment from within the class namespace. Use the methods defined for the assignment for all other operations.'
